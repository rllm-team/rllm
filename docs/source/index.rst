rLLM Documentation
===================
`rLLM <http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20157>`__ (relationLLM) is an easy-to-use Pytorch library for Relational Table Learning with LLMs, by performing two key functions:

1. Breaks down state-of-the-art GNNs, LLMs, and TNNs as standardized modules.
2. Facilitates novel model building in a "combine, align, and co-train" way using these modules.

Highlight Features:

- LLM-friendly: Modular interface designed for LLM-oriented applications, integrating smoothly with LangChain and Hugging Face transformers.
- One-Fit-All Potential: Processes various graphs (like Social/Citation/E-commerce Networks) by treating them as multiple tables linked by foreign keys.
- Novel Datasets: Introduces three new relational table datasets useful for RTL-typle model design. Includes standard tasks like classification and regression, with examples and baseline results.
- Community Support: Maintained by students and teachers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University. Supports the SJTU undergraduate course "Content Understanding (NIS4301)" and the graduate course "Social Network Analysis (NIS8023)".
