    r"""The RECTTransform class is based on the method described in the
    `"Network Embedding with Completely-imbalanced Labels"
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03545>`__ paper. This transform applies a
    series of transformations to a graph, including feature normalization,
    reduce the dimensionality of the features and adjacency matrix
    normalization.

    Args:
        normalize_features (str): The method for normalizing features
            (default: "l1").
        svd_out_dim (int): The output dimensionality after SVD feature
            reduction (default: 200).
        use_gdc (bool): Whether to use Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC)
            instead of GCN normalization (default: False).
