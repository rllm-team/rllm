DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

rel-movielens1m extends the original Movielens-1M dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) with enriched movie data. This new version contains 6040 users, 3883 movies, and 1000209 ratings. Leveraging each MovielensID's corresponding movie page on movielens.org, we further fetch some "time-invariant" metadata for movies, including: Director, Cast, Runtime, Languages, Certificate, Plot, and Url.


ENHANCED MOVIE DATA FORMAT
================================================================================

movies.csv follows the format outlined below:
MovielensID,Title,Year,Genre,Director,Cast,Runtime,Languages,Certificate,Plot,Url

- MovielensID: This is the movie's id on the movielens website, inherited from the original Movielens-1M dataset.
- Title: The title of the movie, sourced from the movielens website.
- Year: The release year of the movie, sourced from the movielens website.

SOME SPECIAL NOTES
================================================================================

1. Please note that due to the age of the Movielens-1M dataset, some MovielensID values no longer correspond to actual pages, meaning there is a discrepancy between MovielensID and the actual page ID on the movielens website.

For movies facing this issue, we have extracted information from their actual pages. However, to minimize changes, we have not modified their MovielensID. Here is a list of such movies with their MovielensID and real ID:

   * 3589: Original ID changed to 54605
   * 557: Original ID changed to 8739
   * 578: Original ID changed to 6531
   * 669: Original ID changed to 6918
   * 863: Original ID changed to 193303
   * 978: Original ID changed to 4970
   * 1108: Original ID changed to 6677
   * 1205: Original ID changed to 4006
   * 1294: Original ID changed to 5060
   * 1362: Original ID changed to 4424
   * 1494: Original ID changed to 6425
   * 1868: Original ID changed to 6474
   * 2645: Original ID changed to 5649
   * 3027: Original ID changed to 203829
   * 3366: Original ID changed to 6808
   * 3416: Original ID changed to 6460
   * 3482: Original ID changed to 72267
   * 3532: Original ID changed to 5560
   * 3842: Original ID changed to 5717
   * 3935: Original ID changed to 6910

1. Additionally, there are some other issues:
	
   * Movie with MovielensID 2228 in movielens is missing, so we use information from IMDB.
   * Movies with MovielensID 1741 and 1758 are duplicates of 1795 and 2563 respectively.

2. Users and Ratings file are followed original format.

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUPLENS RESEARCH PROJECT
================================================================================

The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of 
Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Members of 
the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects related 
to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and 
recommender systems. The project is lead by professors John Riedl and Joseph 
Konstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative filtering in 
1992, but is most well known for its world wide trial of an automated 
collaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996. Since then the project 
has expanded its scope to research overall information filtering solutions, 
integrating in content-based methods as well as improving current collaborative 
filtering technology.

Further information on the GroupLens Research project, including research 
publications, can be found at the following web site:

GroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on 
collaborative filtering:
