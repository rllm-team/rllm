DESCRIPTION
================================================================================

- This is a regression task, aiming to predict the rating a user would give to a particular movie.

- The "ratings" folder contains the training, validation, and testing sets, which is split by 8-1-1 proportion.

- Supplementary information is available in users.csv and movies.csv.


Output Format
================================================================================

- Since the test.csv file contains a total of 97383 rows, the task is to provide a vector/tensor of dimensions 1*97383.

- Additionally, you need to compare your predictions with the actual ratings and provide your Mean Absolute Error.
