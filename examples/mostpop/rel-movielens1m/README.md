# Regression task
This is the algorithm implemented by the seventh group (members Xu Xinyue, Chen Xiaoran, Yang Yufei) to solve the regression task.

## Installation
Make sure you have a CUDA enviroment to accelarate since the deep-learning models could be based on it.
Then install from pip:
```
pip install daisyRec
```

## Train and test run
In order to be able to call the correct library, you need to add the path where the G7-Regression folder resides to the preferred import path before import in train.py
Then run:
```
python train.py
```
