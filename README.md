*Latest News* üî•  
- [2024.12] rLLM was featured in the famous technical magzine **MIT Technology Review**. Read the report [here (Chinese)](https://www.mittrchina.com/news/detail/14162) or [here (English)](https://www-mittrchina-com.translate.goog/news/detail/14162?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp).  
- [2024.11] This work has been approved by **Snowflake** (AI Data Cloud leader, NYSE: $57.46B) as a nice tool for RTL-type tasks. See paper: [arXiv:2411.11829](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11829).
- [2024.10] We have recently added the state-of-the-art GNN method **OGC** [[TNNLS 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13599)], the TNN method **ExcelFormer** [[KDD 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02819)] and **Trompt** [[ICML 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18446)].  
- [2024.08] **rLLM is supported by the CCF-Huawei Populus Grove Fund (CCF-Âçé‰∏∫ËÉ°Êù®ÊûóÂü∫ÈáëÊï∞ÊçÆÂ∫ì‰∏ìÈ°π).** This project focuses on *Tabular Data Governance for AI Tasks*. Watch a short introduction video on Huawei's official account: [üì∫ Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qz421i7Yz). 
- [2024.07] We have released rLLM (v0.1), and the detailed documentation is now available: [rLLM Documentation](https://relationllm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## About

**rLLM** (relationLLM) is an easy-to-use Pytorch library for Relational Table Learning (RTL) with LLMs, by performing two key functions:
1. Breaks down state-of-the-art GNNs, LLMs, and TNNs as standardized modules.
2. Facilitates novel model building in a "combine, align, and co-train" way.

</p>

### How to Try:
Let's run an RTL-type method [BRIDGE](./examples/bridge) as an example:

```bash
# cd ./examples
# set parameters if necessary

python bridge/bridge_tml1m.py
python bridge/bridge_tlf2k.py
python bridge/bridge_tacm12k.py
```


### Highlight Features: 
- **LLM-friendly:** Modular interface designed for LLM-oriented applications, integrating smoothly with LangChain and Hugging Face transformers.
- **One-Fit-All Potential:**  Processes various graphs (like Social/Citation/E-commerce Networks) by treating them as multiple tables linked by foreigner keys. 
- **Novel Datasets:**  Introduces three new relational table datasets useful for RTL model design. Includes the standard classification task, with examples.
- **Community Support:**  Maintained by students and teachers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University. Supports the SJTU undergraduate course "Content Understanding (NIS4301)" and the graduate course "Social Network Analysis (NIS8023)".

## Implemented Methods
rLLM includes over 15 state-of-the-art GNN and TNN models, ideal for both standalone use and building RTL-type methods. Highlighted models include:  

- **OGC**: *From Cluster Assumption to Graph Convolution: Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning Revisited* [[TNNLS 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13599)] [[Example](https://github.com/rllm-team/rllm/blob/main/examples/ogc.py)]  
- **ExcelFormer**: *ExcelFormer: A Neural Network Surpassing GBDTs on Tabular Data* [[KDD 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02819)] [[Example](https://github.com/rllm-team/rllm/blob/main/examples/excelformer.py)]  
- **TAPE**: *Harnessing Explanations: LLM-to-LM Interpreter for Enhanced Text-Attributed Graph Representation Learning* [[ICLR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19523)] [[Example](https://github.com/rllm-team/rllm/tree/main/examples/tape)]  
- **Label-Free-GNN**: *Label-free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models* [[ICLR 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04668)] [[Example](https://github.com/rllm-team/rllm/blob/main/examples/ogc.py)]  
- **Trompt**: *Towards a Better Deep Neural Network for Tabular Data*  [[ICML 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18446)] [[Example](https://github.com/rllm-team/rllm/blob/main/examples/trompt.py)]
